    <p>Greater intersectoral and inter-ministerial collaboration is central to the Commission’s proposals to promote health in South Africa.</p>
    <p>Health is not just a medical issue. The social determinants of health need to be addressed, including promoting healthy behaviours and lifestyles.</p>
    <p>A major goal is to reduce the disease burden to manageable levels.</p>
    <p>Human capacity is key. Managers, doctors, nurses and community health workers need to be appropriately trained and managed, produced in adequate numbers, and deployed where they are most needed.</p>
    <p>The national health system as a whole needs to be strengthened by improving governance and eliminating infrastructure backlogs.</p>
    <p>A national health insurance system needs to be implemented in phases, complemented by a reduction in the relative cost of private medical care and supported by better human capacity and systems in the public health sector.</p>  

<?php } elseif ($page == 'education') { ?>

    <p>The South African education system needs urgent action. Building national capabilities requires quality early childhood development, basic education, further and higher education.</p>
    <p>Early childhood development should be broadly defined, taking into account all the development needs of a child, and provided to all children.</p>
    <p>The priorities in basic education are human capacity, school management, district support, infrastructure and results-oriented mutual accountability between schools and communities.</p>
    <p>Further Education and Training colleges, public adult learning centres, sector education and training authorities, professional colleges and Community Education and Training Centres are important elements of the post-school system that provide diverse learning opportunities.</p>
    <p>Further education should expand moderately, and as quality improves/expands rapidly, higher education should incorporate a range of different institutions that work together to serve different priorities, including effective regulatory and advisory institutions.</p>
    <p>Distance education, aided by advanced information communication technology, will play a greater role in expanding learning opportunities for different groups of learners and promote lifelong learning and continuous professional development. Private providers will continue to be important partners in the delivery of education and training at all levels.</p>
    <p>Research and innovation by universities, science councils, departments, NGOs and the private sector has a key role to play in improving South Africa’s global competitiveness. Coordination between the different role-payers is important.</p>

<?php } elseif ($page == 'social-protection') { ?>

    <p>A social floor is defined and a multi-pronged strategy recommended to ensure that no household lives below this floor. Problems such as poverty induced hunger, malnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies will be addressed.</p>
    <p>Create an inclusive social protection system that addresses all areas of vulnerability and is responsive to the needs, realities, conditions and livelihoods of those who are most at risk.</p>
    <p>Provide support that builds and utilises the capabilities of individuals, households, communities and NGOs to promote self reliant sustainable development.</p>
    <p>Encourage a culture of individual saving for risks associated with loss of income due to unemployment, old age and illness by providing appropriate frameworks and incentives.</p>
    <p>Enhance services and programmes for labour market activation for the unemployed and create opportunities in public employment.</p>

    <p>In 2012, the National Planning Committee authored an ambitious vision document. It details actions to be taken and goals to be met to reduce inequality and poverty in South Africa by 2030.</p>
    <p>This site aims to make the plan accessible to citizens, and highlight progress made towards the NPD objectives. Public and private sectors, and citizens, are called to work together to achieve the common goals. The site allows you to explore the NDP and view organisations and projects working towards its objectives. The tracking and measuring of progress towards the end goals is crucial to achieve the vision. This project is currently a feasibility study and focuses on health, education and social protection.
